# Conducting Evolutionary Analysis on Most Endangered Primate’s Species Through Phylogenetic Tree Study 👨🏻‍💻

## Background
Identifying and conserving the genetic diversity within primate species is essential for their long-term survival. Phylogenetic analysis can inform conservation strategies by highlighting the importance of preserving genetic diversity within populations and recognizing unique evolutionary lineages that should be protected.

A phylogenetic tree, often referred to as a phylogeny, is a graphical representation of the evolutionary history and relationships among a group of species or organisms. It is a fundamental tool in the field of evolutionary biology and provides a way to depict the branching patterns that connect all living and extinct species, showcasing the common ancestry and divergence of life on Earth. The construction and analysis of phylogenetic trees help scientists better understand the evolutionary processes that have shaped the diversity of life. Phylogenetic trees serve as visual representations of the evolutionary connections among species, enabling scientists to make predictions about their common ancestors, shared traits, and evolutionary trajectories. These trees are continually updated as new data and techniques improve our understanding of the history of life on Earth.
